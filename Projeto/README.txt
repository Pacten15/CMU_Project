To execute the project in the emulator, follow these steps:

1. Open the folder "PharmacIST" in Android Studio. The folder will be recognized as an Android project by the Android icon that appears in the file manager provided by the Android Studio IDE.
2. Wait for Gradle to build the project.
3. Go to Device Manager and click the plus icon. Then, click "Create Virtual Device," which will lead to a menu to create a virtual emulator of a specific model and Android version. The preferable model and version of the emulated device is a Pixel 6 using the VanillaIceCream Google API, which is essentially Android 14.
4. Select the new device emulator created, which will appear next to the app text, and click the play button.
5. Register a user for yourself.
6. Log in with the user created.
7. Use the app as you please. The way the project works is presented in the report.

Side Note: The barcode reader does not work on the emulator; it only works with non-emulated smartphones. So, when the button to scan a barcode is clicked, it will do nothing.

To execute the project using a real smartphone with an Android operating system, follow these steps:

1. Open the folder "PharmacIST" in Android Studio. The folder will be recognized as an Android project by the Android icon that appears in the file manager provided by the Android Studio IDE.
2. Wait for Gradle to build the project.
3. Verify if your device is being recognized by the IDE.
4. If your device is not recognized, activate the programmer mode of your smartphone. This process depends on the model, so if you do not know how to do it, please search for instructions specific to your model.
5. Now, with Android Studio recognizing your device, just press the play button and accept the installation of the app on your smartphone, assuming you will receive a pop-up to do so.
6. The app will be executed right after and can be used.
7. Register a user for yourself.
8. Log in with the user created.
9. Use the app as you please. The way the project works is presented in the report.
